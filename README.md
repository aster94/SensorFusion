Using IMUs is one of the most struggling part of every Arduino lovers, here there is a simple solution.

This library will work with every IMU, it just need the raw data of gyroscope and accelerometer (the magnetometer isn't mandatory), it is based on these two libraries:
- https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/MahonyAHRS 
- https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/MadgwickAHRS 

I just made small modifications in the way the libraries handled the timing between two measurements and melted them together


## Installation
Use the arduino/platformIO library manager or download directly from github

I am using an STM32F103F103 known as blue pill but also any Arduino board will work

The IMU is a cheap MPU9250, you could find it everywhere for about 2â‚¬ (eBay, Aliexpress, ecc), to use it I strongly suggest you [this library](https://github.com/bolderflight/MPU9250)

If you wish use `IMU_tester` in the extras folder to see how you IMU works (needs Processing)
Note: I am using also this very useful library: [Streaming](https://github.com/geneReeves/ArduinoStreaming)
